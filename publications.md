          <strong>Stigma Leads to Avoidance of Mental Health Information: Behavioral Economics Approach <em>(Job Market Paper)</em>

Abstract:</p> This study experimentally examines how individual level mental health stigma affects self-evaluation of mental fitness and demand for diagnostic information. In my randomized priming experiment, two groups of subjects read some facts about depression with either negative or positive connotations. Next, they were asked to report their self-assessment of their own depression severity and willingness to receive the diagnostic information. Among married and also employed subjects, under-assessment of symptom severity and avoidance of diagnostic information were more likely to be observed among those who read negative messages about depression compared to those who read positive messages. The results tentatively support a theory in which individuals are motivated to hold positively biased beliefs about their mental fitness by being selectively exposed to information, and mental health stigma plays a mediating role during the process. Also, these findings provide a potential explanation regarding depressed individuals’ simultaneous manifestation of denial about their depression and reluctance in help-seeking.</p></div>
